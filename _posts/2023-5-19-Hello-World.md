title: What’s this blog all about?
---
Hi, my name is Syd. I’m starting this blog to document my path into the cybersecurity field. I’m hoping these posts can serve as a demonstration of my interests and abilities and help me share knowledge and resources with other folks in the security community. I’m honestly nervous to share my writing and projects publicly, but I want to face my fears and use this as an opportunity to improve my writing as well as my technical skills. 

### A bit about me

I’m currently working in IT support, primarily in K-8 schools. Most of my daily work involves either working onsite at schools troubleshooting tech issues with teachers and students, or working in an office repairing broken devices. I’ve recently started teaching after-school coding and makerspace classes for 2nd through 6th graders, and I really love it. I’ve always enjoyed sharing my knowledge, and I love seeing the kids I work with get excited about technology.

### What to expect from this blog

One of my primary goals for this blog is to showcase the projects I’m working on. Not all of these projects will have a security focus - some will be more generally technology or programming related, and I may end up sharing other personal projects. I’m still figuring out what specific roles and career paths most interest me in the cybersecurity field, and I’m hoping that by taking on a variety of projects I can discover what I find most engaging. 

I also hope this blog can be a useful resource for other folks early on in their security career journeys. I intend to share notes, summaries, and reviews of existing security resources. There are so many great free resources out there for learning about security, but knowing where to start investing my time and energy has been a challenge. I want to share the resources and key takeaways that have been most helpful to me, and I hope to save other learners’ precious time.

### My first project… the blog itself

I have a tendency to overthink things. I’ve spent a lot of time agonizing over where to host this blog - will people judge me if I don’t host it myself? Will they judge me if I do and it’s not good enough? I got a recommendation to use Medium for hosting my writing, and even hit publish on a version of this post over there. I ended up unlisting it after a minute. The biggest selling point of Medium for me is its minimalism and lack of ads, but tacked on at the bottom of my post were a couple clickbait-y articles "Recommended from Medium.” It also just… doesn’t feel like a blog to me. I don’t want to direct people to my profile on Medium, I want to send them a link to *my* site.

I thought about all the blogs I read regularly - I have them bookmarked and enjoy taking the time to visit each site when I want to read that content. I enjoy their quirks and easter eggs. I am so tired of all the walled gardens of the internet, so it would be pretty hypocritical of me to confine my own blog within some platform's limitations and restrictions.

I ended up deciding to use GitHub Pages. It’s free, I want more practice using Git and GitHub anyway, and there are a lot of nice tutorials to pick from on using it as a blogging platform. I used Barry Clark’s [Jekyll Now](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) theme for this site. It’s very bare bones right now, but I’ll post updates here as I work more on this site and make it mine.

### In conclusion

Thanks for reading my first blog post. Here’s to more!
